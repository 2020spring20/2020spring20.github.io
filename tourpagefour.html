The soccer field, or football pitch, is flexible in size. It is 100 to 130 yards (90-120m) long and 50 to 100 yards (45-90m) wide. In international play the field dimensions are a bit stricter in that the length must be 110 to 120 yards (100 - 110m) long and 70 to 80 yards (64 - 75m) wide.

Eventually an additional rule was made that the length has to be longer than the width, so you couldn't have a square field of 100 yards by 100 yards.

Even though these are the official rules, many kid's soccer games are played on even smaller fields than the minimum. Although the length and width are flexible, other areas of the field are generally fixed in size.

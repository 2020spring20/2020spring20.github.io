The history of the soccer ball dates back to ancient times. From a couple centuries BC to about 200 AD, the Chinese used balls made from animal skins in a game called 'tsu chu', in which players had to pass them through a net stretched between two poles. The ancient Greeks, Romans, and even the Egyptians are recorded to have enjoyed a similar game that involved kicking a makeshift ball.
Legend has it, entire villages got involved in a violent game of skull-kicking. And it was customary to play a game much like hackysack. But instead of using the feet to keep a bean bag aloft, the object was to keep a pig bladder in the air.

Thankfully the soccer ball has evolved.

It wasn't until the twentieth century that most soccer balls were made out of rubber. Charles Goodyear in 1855 created the first vulcanized rubber soccer ball. Panels similar to that of today's basketball were glued together at the seams. Before that, the soccer ball game was at the mercy of the size and shape of the pig's bladder. That presented problems. The ball rarely went where players intended for it to.

So in 1862 a fellow by the name of H. J. Lindon developed an inflatable rubber bladder. Now the soccer ball would be easier to kick. And it could endure the regiments of the game without losing its shape.

Eventually the soccer ball needed an official size and weight. That would be the job of the English Football Association. In 1872 it described the ball as "spherical with a circumfrence of 27 to 28 inches" (68.6 cm to 71.1 cm). The weight would be 13-15 oz. Little change was made until 1937, when its weight increased to 14-16 oz. According to the Law of Football, the ball must also possess an "outer casing of leather or other approved materials". The only other thing that's changed to this day are the materials that comprise the soccer ball, and the size and shape of its panels.

The football goals used in the modern game have evolved greatly since the original laws of the game were drawn up.

The 1848 Cambridge Rules stated that a goal should be awarded when the ball passed between upright posts and a string. No reference was made to the width or the height of the goal posts.

In 1863 the newly formed Football Association drew up their rules which declared that the goal posts should 24 feet apart, this ruling still remains in place in today’s modern game.

However, there were still no measurements given for the height of the goal. A goal could be scored at any height as long as the ball passed between the posts. This gave cause for many arguments during games. Was a goal scored? Did the ball pass between the posts? Teams could just not agree.

The string crossbar used on the original goals was replaced by tape for the first ever FA cup final in 1872. The crossbar was finally made compulsory in the FA rules of 1882, which specified that it should be at a measurement of 8 feet above the ground.
